All Noto fonts now licensed under Open Font License 1.1
=======================================================

With the new release we have moved from Apache 2.0 to Open Font License 1.1 (OFL 1.1).  We
are making this change because it makes it easier for you, the end users of Noto, to use
the fonts that we produce.  When we first released the Noto fonts the OFL license was
still a bit of an unknown entity and the Apache license looked familiar to us.  Over the
years the OFL license has become the most commonly used and understood license to use for
open source fonts.

All of our fonts going forward from this release will be available only under the OFL
license.  If you still want the fonts under the Apache license you can get them from the
repo using the tag '2015-09-29-license-apache'.  However, new fonts and updates to
existing fonts will only use the OFL license.
